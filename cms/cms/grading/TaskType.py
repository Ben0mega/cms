"""In this file there are two things:
- the basic infrastructure from which we can build a task type;
- the implementations of the most common task types.

Basically, a task type is a class that receives a submission and knows
how to compile and evaluate it. A worker creates a task type to work
on a submission, and all low-level details on how to implement the
compilation and the evaluation are contained in the task type class.
